##Welcome to the Lunchbox wiki!##
A selection of tools to use in C++. These are here mainly for my own sake, but anyone is welcome to use these in their own projects. I'm welcome to any suggestions, and would appreciate any feedback.  
  
### Tools ###
- [lbConfig](https://github.com/Samuel-Lewis/lunchbox/wiki/lbConfig): Lightweight config file reader
- [lbCSV](https://github.com/Samuel-Lewis/lunchbox/wiki/lbCSV): Reads CSV files into your program
- [lbFile](https://github.com/Samuel-Lewis/lunchbox/wiki/lbFile): File reading, searching and manipulation. _WIP_.
- [lbLog](https://github.com/Samuel-Lewis/lunchbox/wiki/lbLog): Run-time and external file logging.
- [lbRNG](https://github.com/Samuel-Lewis/lunchbox/wiki/lbRNG): Random number generation on certain distributions. _WIP_.
- [lbString](https://github.com/Samuel-Lewis/lunchbox/wiki/lbString): String manipulation and searching.

### Install Details ###
It's a pretty basic install. All you really need to do is download the repo and put it in your project.
There is a generic Makefile included if needed.
Make sure to download the entire toolset, and keep it all together, as some of the tools are dependant on the others.

In the future, I might seperate into 'core' and 'extras', but I need more to do that.
