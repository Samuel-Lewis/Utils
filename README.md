##Welcome to the Lunchbox wiki!##
A selection of tools to use in C++. These are here mainly for my own sake, but anyone is welcome to use these in their own projects. I'm welcome to any suggestions, and would appreciate any feedback.  
  
Current tools include:
- [lbCSV](https://github.com/Samuel-Lewis/lunchbox/wiki/lbCSV): Reads CSV files into your program
- [lbLog](https://github.com/Samuel-Lewis/lunchbox/wiki/lbLog): Run-time and external file logging.
- [lbString](https://github.com/Samuel-Lewis/lunchbox/wiki/lbString): String manipulation and searching.
- [lbRNG](https://github.com/Samuel-Lewis/lunchbox/wiki/lbRNG): Random number generation on certain distributions. WIP.  

Planned tools:
- Command line tool
- Custom config file reader
